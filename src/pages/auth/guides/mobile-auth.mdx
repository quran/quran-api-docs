# OAuth2 with Quran.com using a mobile app

Please make sure to read our guide on how to get started with [OAuth2 integration](/auth/guides/getting-started-with-oauth2).

## Obtaining OAuth 2.0 client credentials

As we mentioned in the guide, to obtain your client credentials, you need to contact [us](mailto:osama@quran.com). Please make sure to mention that it's meant for usage on mobile apps so we enable [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) support.

## Example

We have created an [Example](https://github.com/quran/oauth2-react-native-client-example) OAuth2 React Native client that connects to Quran.com Authorization server.
