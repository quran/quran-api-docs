Quran.com's OAuth 2.0 APIs can be used for both authentication and authorization.
This document describes our OAuth 2.0 implementation for authentication.

In this [tutorial](/auth/guides/oauth2-tutorial),
we explained a full tutorial on how to use Quran.com's OAuth as authentiacation and authorization.

In the tutorial you will notice that we include `openid` as one of the scope.
And you will see that we have `access_token` and `id_token` jwt in the response callback.
That can be used to authenticate and identify the user.

Try to decode the `id_token`, you will see that it contains information about the users. Here's an example

```
{
  "at_hash": "tGJSmRygf5HXuZx1YDP1",
  "aud": [
    "quran-demo"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1675234788,
  "email": "muhajirframe@gmail.com",
  "exp": 1677591803,
  "first_name": "Muhammad",
  "iat": 1677588203,
  "iss": "https://oauth2.quran.com/",
  "jti": "a144b79e-3e50-40b8-8053c462000",
  "last_name": "Muhajir",
  "rat": 1677588190,
  "sid": "ce2ae21b-87ed-40fb-b4c24dc898df7",
  "sub": "a4f5a01a-a641-4b23-ba002b704bfaa"
}
```

export default ({ children }) => (
  <GuideLayout title="OpenId Connect">{children}</GuideLayout>
