# OpenID Connect

Quran.com's OAuth 2.0 APIs can be used for both authentication and authorization.

In this [guide](/auth/guides/getting-started-with-oauth2), we have breifly explained what OAuth2 is and how to integrate with Quran.com's OAuth2 server.

Besides OAuth2, Quran.com also supports [OpenId Connect](https://openid.net/connect) standards by providing the [UserInfo Endpoint](/auth/v1/operations/getOidcUserInfo) to get more information about the user.

To be able to access OpenId Connect's endpoints, make sure to include `openid` in the list of requested [scopes](/auth/guides/scopes). Once this is done, besides `access_token`, the authorization callback will also contain a [JWT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519) `id_token` parameter.

`id_token` can be decoded using one of the JWT [libraries](https://jwt.io/libraries) to know more about the identity of the user. Below is an example of a decoded `id_token`:

```
{
  "at_hash": "tGJSmRygf5HXuZx1YDP1",
  "aud": [
    "quran-demo"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1675234788,
  "email": "xyz@example.com",
  "exp": 1677591803,
  "first_name": "Muhammad",

  "iss": "https://oauth2.quran.com/",
  "jti": "a144b79e-3e50-40b8-8053c462000",

}
